what did you hope to learn but did not?
	I hope to learn more about Javascript .
what did you really enjoy learning about?
	Both those basic techniques like html, javascript, and css, and 
	the currting-edge techniques like react and redux. 
What worked well in the course? and how?
 homework is too much  but it really enhance my skills
	
What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
	I think if we can get the slides earlier, we can have more time to read them 
	in advance to keep pace with course.

What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class
exercises, goals of projects â€“ and be specific please!
	I think there are more materials about these concepts because there are too many concepts and techniques in this area.
